\\begin{abstract}
This paper examines various techniques for identifying distinctive speech patterns in political discourse. We analyze audio features including MFCCs, pitch variations, and speech rhythm to create a computational model for speaker identification. Our experiments demonstrate that a combined approach utilizing both textual and audio analysis yields superior results compared to single-modality approaches.

\\section{Introduction}
Speech pattern recognition has become increasingly important in various fields, including political discourse analysis, speaker verification, and media studies. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled more accurate identification of specific speakers based on their unique vocal characteristics \\citep{smith2022}.

\\section{Methodology}
Our approach combines traditional audio feature extraction with neural network-based classification. We extract Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), pitch contours, and rhythm metrics to create a comprehensive feature vector for each audio sample.

\\subsection{Feature Extraction}
For each audio sample, we extract the following features:
\\begin{itemize}
    \\item 13 MFCCs and their statistical variations
    \\item Fundamental frequency (F0) characteristics
    \\item Speech rate and rhythm metrics
    \\item Spectral contrast features
    \\item Energy distribution patterns
\\end{itemize}

\\subsection{Model Architecture}
We implement a multi-layer neural network with the following structure:
\\begin{equation}
f(x) = \\sigma(W_3 \\cdot \\sigma(W_2 \\cdot \\sigma(W_1 \\cdot x + b_1) + b_2) + b_3)
\\end{equation}
where $\\sigma$ represents the ReLU activation function, and $W_i$ and $b_i$ are the weights and biases of layer $i$.

\\section{Results}
Our experiments were conducted on a dataset of 120 speech samples from 8 different political speakers. Table \\ref{tab:results} presents the accuracy scores for different feature combinations.

\\begin{table}[h]

\\caption{Performance of Different Feature Sets}
\\label{tab:results}
\\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\\toprule
\\textbf{Feature Set} & \\textbf{Precision} & \\textbf{Recall} & \\textbf{F1 Score} \\\\
\\midrule
MFCCs only & 0.78 & 0.75 & 0.76 \\\\
Pitch + Rhythm & 0.65 & 0.62 & 0.63 \\\\
Spectral Features & 0.72 & 0.69 & 0.70 \\\\
All Audio Features & 0.85 & 0.83 & 0.84 \\\\
Text + Audio (Combined) & \\textbf{0.92} & \\textbf{0.91} & \\textbf{0.91} \\\\
\\bottomrule
\\end{tabular}
\\end{table}

As shown in Table \\ref{tab:results}, the combination of textual and audio features yields the highest performance metrics, with an F1 score of 0.91.

\\section{Discussion}
The experimental results demonstrate that while individual feature sets provide reasonable accuracy, the combined approach significantly outperforms single-modality methods. This suggests that speech patterns are manifested through multiple dimensions that should be analyzed together.

\\subsection{Feature Importance}
Further analysis of feature importance revealed that certain MFCCs (particularly MFCC-2 and MFCC-4) and pitch variation metrics were the most discriminative individual features. However, the synergistic effect of combining features from different categories produced the most robust model.

\\section{Conclusion}
This study presents a comprehensive framework for political speech pattern analysis that leverages both audio and textual features. Our results indicate that multi-modal approaches significantly outperform single-modality methods in speaker identification tasks.

\\section{Future Work}
Future research directions include:
\\begin{itemize}
    \\item Incorporating contextual factors into the analysis
    \\item Exploring temporal dependencies through recurrent neural networks
    \\item Developing unsupervised approaches for feature discovery
\\end{itemize}
